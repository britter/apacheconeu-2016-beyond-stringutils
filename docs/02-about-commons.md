  <dt>proper</dt>
  <dd>Mature components like Lang, IO, Math.</dd>

  <dt>sandbox</dt>

  <dt>dormant</dt>
  <dd>attic inside of commons.</dd>
</dl>

Note:
- Not all proper components have a release
    - (Almost) no dependencies
    - Conservative development model
- No process for graduating from sandbox to proper
- working on moving more stuff to dormant
